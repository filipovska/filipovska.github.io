					<h2>Research Interests</h2>
					<p>

						<br />My overall research vision is to advance the theoretical, methodological and experimental aspects of
						transportation systems engineering and operations research as applied to dynamic transportation
						networks, emerging vehicle and infrastructure techngologies in transportation, and intelligent transportation systems.
						I am especially interested in developing strategies to improve the performance, mobility, and reliability of
						transportation systems.
						<br />
						<br />To tackle the complex problems in these constantly evolving research areas in transportation, I employ a
						multidisciplinary approach that draws on tools from operations research, network science, machine learning,
						data science, traffic flow modeling and control theory.
						<br />
						<br />I am dedicated to working on problems important to advancing research in transportation
						science and engineering, and approaching them with data-driven methods, rigorous optimization 
						and statistical approaches that make them highly relevant for real-world applications.
					</p>
					<h2>Dissertation Research</h2>
					<p>
						My dissertation titled ‘Travel time reliability in stochastic dynamic networks: modeling, path finding,
						and routing’, characterizes transportation networks with stochastic time-varying and correlated travel
						times, where reliability is an important factor for the decision making of travelers and system operators.
						My work proposes stochastic optimization approaches for path finding and information-adaptive routing under
						uncertainty and devises a framework for routing guidance to improve the system efficiency and reliability.
						Unifying the travel time reliability modeling and optimization problems for stochastic transportation
						networks and proposing solution approaches suitable for large-scale applications are two important
						contributions of my current research.
