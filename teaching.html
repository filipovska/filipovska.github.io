					<h2>Multi-disciplinary Evidence-Based Teaching Approach</h2>
					<ul class="main">
						<p>
							Like my approach to research, my teaching emphasizes a systems approach to transportation and
							a multidisciplinary approach to engineering as a whole. In my teaching I strive to strike a
							balance between providing students with the theoretical and conceptual knowledge necessary to
							understand transportation systems and making sure they develop the analytical skills they need
							to tackle complex transportation engineering problems.

							<blockquote>
								“Monika made sure that you understood each concept,
								and was willing to go through and explain anything you wanted.”
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							<blockquote>
								“The classes that Monika taught were great. She was well prepared and
								was able to find ways to engage students virtually which was risky but
								totally worked. I really enjoyed learning from her and thought she did a great job.”
