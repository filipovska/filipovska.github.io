									<h2>Teaching Interests</h2>
									<p> Multidisciplinary evidence-based teaching approach
								</header>

								<section>
									<p>
										Like my approach to research, my teaching emphasizes a systems approach to transportation and
										a multidisciplinary approach to engineering as a whole. In my teaching I strive to strike a
										balance between providing students with the theoretical and conceptual knowledge necessary to
										understand transportation systems and making sure they develop the analytical skills they need
										to tackle complex transportation engineering problems.
									</p>

									<h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
									<p>
										During the Winter and Spring quarters in 2020, I participated in the teaching-as-research program
										at Northwestern’s Searle Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL)
										while co-teaching a course on data analysis for transportation and urban infrastructure systems.
										I incorporated a quarter-long module focusing on applications of the course material in transportation
										and beyond. Additionally, I created an asynchronous, virtual space for student discussions via an online
										discussion platform called Piazza.
										<br />Prior to this experience, I served as a teaching assistant for an introductory engineering analysis
										courses at Northwestern. In the Spring 2021 quarter, I will be co-teaching an engineering systems
										analysis course for undergraduate students.
										<br />
										<br />Through my teaching experience and involvement with the Searle Center for Advancing Teaching and Learning
										and the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network, I have achieved the
										<b>CIRTL Network Scholar</b> certification in 2020.
